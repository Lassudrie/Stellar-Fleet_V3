# Audio Assets (UI Layer)

This directory hosts audio files used by the React UI.

- `sounds/`: short sound effects (UI feedback, notifications).
- `musics/`: longer background tracks or ambience.

These assets are referenced only from UI components; the engine layer must remain agnostic to their presence.
